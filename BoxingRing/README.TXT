PROJECT TITLE: Ultimate Boxing

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Game for final project

VERSION or DATE: Version 1.1, May 8, 2018

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open the greenfoot project from the greenfoot client.

AUTHORS:  Adam Pratt and Benjamin Slater

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Upon starting the game in the greenfoot client, clicking anywhere on the start fight 
image will begin a fight.
The boxer in green and black with his back to the screen is controlled by the player, while the red boxer 
is controlled by the computer.

The player can block by holding 's,' punch left with 'a,' and punch right with 'd.'  If no key is pressed 
the boxer will do nothing.

The players remaining health is displayed as a bar in the upper left corner of the screen, and the enemy's 
health is in the upper right.  When a fighter that is not blocking is hit with a punch, they will lose some 
health.

The player wins by reducing the computer controlled fighter's health to zero, but loses if they run out of 
health first. Points are earned by the player every time they hit the enemy.  The number of points depends
on how many consecutive punches the player has landed without being hit themselves.
